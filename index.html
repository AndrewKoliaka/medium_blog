                        to users. They’re reliable, fast, and engaging. They originate from a secure origin and load regardless

                    <p>There’s much new in the world of <a href="#">Progressive Web Apps</a> (PWAs) and you might be wondering
                        how compatible they are with existing architectures using libraries like <a href="#">React</a> and
                        JS module bundlers like
                        <a href="#">Webpack</a>. Does a PWA require a wholesale rewrite? What web performance metrics do
                        you need to keep an eye on? In this series of posts I’ll share my experience turning React-based
                        web apps into PWAs. We’ll also cover why shipping just what users need for a route & throwing out
                        all other scripts are good ideas for fast perf.</p>

                            Super cool.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of what libraries are in your stack, I want to emphasize that everything in the above
                            list can be accomplished today with a little work. There are caveats however.</p>
                        <p><b>We know the mobile web is <a href="#">slow</a>.</b></p>
                        <p>The web has evolved from a document-centric platform to a first-class application platform. At the same time the bulk of our computing has moved from powerful desktop machines with fast, reliable network connections to relatively underpowered mobile devices with connections that are often <i>slow, flaky or both</i>. This is especially true in parts of the world where the next billion users are coming online. To unlock a faster mobile web:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>We need to collectively shift to testing on real mobile devices under realistic network connections</b>                                (e.g <a href="#">Regular 3G in DevTools</a>). <a href="#">chrome://inspect</a> and <a href="#">WebPageTest</a>                                (<a href="#">video</a>) are your friend. Lighthouse emulates a Nexus 5X with touch events,
                                viewport emulation and a throttled network connection (150ms latency, 1.6Mbps throughput).</li>

                                seconds on a representative device so more of that budget for our app code is ❤

                                        With some work, it’s possible to write PWAs with React that do perform well on real devices under limited network conditions <a href="#">as demonstrated by Housing.com</a>. We’ll talk about how to achieve this in great <b>detail</b> later on in the series.

                            With a Web App manifest setup, you also get access to app installer banners, giving you a way to natively prompt for users
                            to install your PWA if they find themselves engaging with it often. It’s also possible to defer
                            the prompt until a time when a user has a useful interaction with your app. Flipkart found the
                            best time to show the prompt was on their order confirmation page.

                            Installed web app will launch with custom splash screen

                        <p>
                            In older versions of Chrome for Android, tapping on a homescreen icon for an app would often take up to 200ms (or multiple
                            seconds in slow sites) for the first frame of the document to be rendered to the screen.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            During this time, the user would see a white screen, decreasing the perceived performance of your site. Chrome 47 and above
                            <a href="#">support customising a splash screen</a> (based on a background_color, name and icons
                            from the Web App Manifest) used to color the screen until the browser is ready to paint something.
                            This makes your webapp feel a lot closer to “native”.

On iOS, Safari still supports customising add to <a href="#">homescreen icons</a> and used to support a <a href="#">proprietary splashscreen</a> implementation, however this appears to have broken in iOS9.

                            Apps optimized for multiple devices should include a <a href="#">meta-viewport in the &lt;head&gt; of their document</a>.
                            This might seem super obvious, but I’ve seen plenty of React projects where folks have neglected
                            to include this. Thankfully create-react-app does include a valid meta-viewport by default and
                            Lighthouse will flag if it is missing:
                        </p>
                        <code class="text-dark d-block my-4">

                            <a href="#">doesn’t mean desktop should be forgotten</a>. A well-crafted PWA can work well across
                            a range of viewport sizes, browsers and devices, as demonstrated by Housing.com:
